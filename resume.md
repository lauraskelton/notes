I am a software developer with over 10 years of experience.  I love
programing and learning programming languages.  While I prefer 
towards C, Haskell, and Lua,  I have developed in C++, make, python,
bash, clojure, ruby, nemerle, and a bit of arm and hexagon assembly.
I love difficult problems, like debugging an image built from over
9m lines of code on unstable hardware, or optimizing code paths
between heterogeneous cores.  For fun I enjoy working with AI
algorithms like back-propagation, Bayes inference, and Markov models.
I am dedicated to writing bug free code, and I have created a unit
test coverage framework that simulates every exception and gives
developers tools to achieve 100% code and branch coverage.  I would
love to work with a highly skilled and motivated team on difficult
problems.


### EDUCATION ###
UIUC, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, 2003

### WORK EXPERIENCE ###
#### Engineer, Qualcomm, San Diego CA, December 2003 to Present. ####
   * 2011 - Present. Hexagon DSP SDK.
      * High performance RPC between application processor and dsp.
        10 fold reduction in latency over 3 previous implementations,
        2 patents.  Ported to Android, Windows Phone and QNX (C).
      * Module framework for dynamically loading shared objects on
        dsp. (C)
      * IDL compiler (Haskell)
   * 2005 - 2011.  BREW/BMP (mobile OS kernel developer)
      * code
         * RPC implementation for process, co-processor (with
           different instruction sets), as well as languge and
           network boundaries (C).
         * Kernel and user space service frameworks (C).
         * Device driver framework (C).
         * Byte code for low memory rpc (Haskell targeting many
           languages).
         * Declartive C objects with C++ compatible v-tables,
           multiple facets, disjoint inheritance trees in single heap 
           node. Less then 500 bytes of RO arm object code.
      * tools
         * IDL compiler (Haskell).
         * Strace tools for on device debugging (Haskell and Lua).
         * Elf manipulation tool for post build image modification
           (Lua).
         * IDL based component and test generation tool for rapid
           prototyping (Haskell + Lua).
         * Module configuration tool (Lua).
      * optimizations
         * Assembly optimizations for RPC invocations from user to
           kernel.
         * Optimized stack usage during on demand dynamic module
           loading.
         * Code generation optimizations for performance and stack
           and heap usage for the C IDL backend.
   * 2003 - 2005.  QChat, "Push to Talk" server
      * Implemented network components using SIP/HTTP/RTP and
        proprietary standards (C++).
      * Developed high performance logging tools to handle tens of
        thousands of transactions per second from many networked
        components (C++).

#### Founder/Developer, IContrib, San Diego CA, 2012. ####
   * Founding member of a web platform for managing donations.
   * Web backend developer (Haskell).

#### Fonder/Developer, Alescere LLC, Lisle IL, 2001 to 2003. ####
   * Founding member of a VoIP startup.
   * Implemented SIP and RTP protocol stacks, and server components
     for a VoIP system for small businesses  (C++).

#### Research Assistant, Senior Design, UIUC, 2003 ####
   * QoS for the Apache Web server (C).
   * Implemented web server that supports out of order requests (C++).
   * Probabilistic scheduler for the Linux kernel (C).
   * Roaming protocol for 802.11a/b networks for NetBSD (C).

#### Personal Research ####
  * Used and implemented and optimized, neural networks, genetic
    algorithms, Markov chains, and Bayes inference algorithms,
    over gigabytes of data entirely for fun  (mostly Haskell, some C).
